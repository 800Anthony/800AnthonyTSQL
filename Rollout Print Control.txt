

When a patch e.g. CU has been successfully tested in development, we need
to check the print control cab file to see if there is a new version.
This done by checking the dll version number and comparing with live. On
RCBPARS0825, the cab lives here -

- \\rcbpars0825\c$\Program Files\Microsoft SQL
Server\MSRS10_50.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting
Services\ReportServer\bin\RSClientPrint-x86.cab.
